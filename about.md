I am a quantitative landscape ecologist studying how animal movement and landscape structure shape disease dynamics and population-level outcomes. I use geospatial analysis, machine learning, and agent-based modeling to explore questions at the intersection of ecology, animal health, and wildlife management. My work spans systems from free-roaming domestic dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) in Madagascar to invasive wild pigs in the U.S. (Sus scrofus). I am also interested in developing decision support tools and generalizable methods to scale-up ecological insights from empirical data.
I am also a visual artist. In my art, I explore narratives around species interactions and biodiversity through ink, watercolor, digital illustration, and comics. I have exhibited my work in public art projects as well as solo, group and juried exhibitions, and have curated group shows and symposia that explore the intersection of art with ecology and conservation.
