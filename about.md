I am a quantitative landscape ecologist interested in how spatial heterogeneity drives distributional patterns of free-roaming vertebrates and their pathogens by modulating animal movement behavior. 

I inform data-driven mechanistic models such as agent-based simulations with telemetry field studies to understand how movement behaviors of individuals scale-up to population-level pattern and process. My work spans multiple systems but is unified by a focus on how ecological dynamics emerge across fragmented and human-modified landscapes. I am particularly motivated by the translation of these insights into operational strategies for wildlife management including invasive species control, disease mitigation, and habitat connectivity planning. To support this applied dimension, I develop and adapt modeling frameworks that are tailored to the complexities of real-world systems and decision contexts.    

I am also a visual artist. In my art, I explore narratives around species interactions and biodiversity through ink, watercolor, digital illustration, and comics. I have exhibited my work in public art projects as well as solo, group and juried exhibitions, and have curated group shows and symposia that explore the intersection of art with ecology and conservation.
